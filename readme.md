## CHALLENGE DATEV

### DISRUPTING HR PROCESSES WITH AI

Imagine you work in HR and have to scan a couple of hundred applications every week. Then, after having manually answered all the questions the potential candidates had, you’d like to invite the most promising ones to a first interview. However, for some applicants you can only offer a time slot in several weeks due to your and your colleagues’ limited capacities.

It would make life much easier – both for HR teams and for (future) employees – if AI were used to automate processes, thus speed them up, and find the best matches for open positions.

Together with you, your game-changing ideas and the power of AI we want to create the most innovative solutions with a top-notch user experience. Shape the future of HR considering a maximum in data security in order to build strong trust among potential user groups. Redesign existing and repetitive processes in a way that enables faster, more effective and automated management or ensures easy collaboration.

Feel free to consider different areas of an HR journey, no matter if it’s recruiting, smooth onboarding, or individualized employee development tailored to specific strenghts. Increasing candidate diversity could also be an aspect to think about.

Incorporate machine learning, chatbots and speech analytics to achieve a stellar and seamless user experience. The goal is to find innovative solutions that create a better employee experience and make work processes more effective and efficient. Be bold and curious! Keep an eye on the integrability into existing environments, on the requirements of different employee generations and on the future of the internet.
